SteamBulkKeyActivator
=====================

A little macro program that allows you to activate steam keys in bulk

	Add a keys.txt file in the root directory of the binary/script.
	add 1 key per line and save the file.
	run the script/program and it will read line per line of the keys.txt file and activate them one by one in steam.
	After a successful activation it will cancel the game's installation so it does not install.
	
	Do not touch keyboard and or mouse
	you can press escape at any time to cancel the macro
